body: 'Na verdade, existem várias versões pra resposta dessa questão do corvo e da escrivaninha Acho que tinha uma que era "both are nevar (sic) backwards" - a escrivaninha nunca (nevar (sic) ) fica de trás pra frente, e o corvo (raven) é nevar ao contrario. Tinha uma outra que funcionava em português: Poe escreveu sobre ambos (Poe escreveu sobre corvos, e muito provavelmente ele colocava o papel sobre uma escrivaninha pra escrever) ah achei! referências na wiki! (procurei depois de escrever acima, rs...) In Chapter 7, the Hatter gives his famous riddle without an answer: "Why is a raven like a writing desk?" Although Carroll intended the riddle to have no solution, in a new preface to the 1896 edition of Alice, he proposes several answers: "Because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very flat; and it is nevar put with the wrong end in front!" (Note the spelling of "never" as "nevar"—turning it into "raven" when inverted. This spelling, however, was "corrected" in later editions to "never" and Carroll''s pun was lost). Puzzle expert Sam Loyd offered the following solutions: \* Because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes \* Poe wrote on both \* Bills and tales are among their characteristics \* Because they both stand on their legs, conceal their steels (steals), and ought to be made to shut up Many other answers are listed in The Annotated Alice.'
