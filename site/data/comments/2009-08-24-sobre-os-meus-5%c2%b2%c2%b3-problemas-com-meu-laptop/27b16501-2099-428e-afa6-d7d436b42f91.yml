body: 'Olha o que eu achei agorinha mesmo... Informação sobre compatibiidade de processadores Penryn nos modelos COMPAL FL90 / FL91 / FT00 Informação do distribuidor dos Original Design: There will be no BIOS fix for any currently released & delivered Models (i.e. IFL90/91, IFT00/01 or JFT00) to accommodate SRR CPU’s. Only new production of SRR Models on line will support Penryn 800 MHZ CPUs. P.S. The BIOS v115 or v116 mentioned below is for JFT02 or JFL92 models ONLY. Even some of you had loaded on IFL90/91 and running SRR CPUs, we still got no words from R&D confirm it will be working correctly continuously. Don’t count on it! Marasst Incorporation Compal Authorized Distributor Informação do Distribuidor VBI (Verified by INTEL): Dear Customer; Please note that we have encountered increased number of technical queries regarding the Penryn processor use on Santa Rosa barebones. Hereby we would like to clarify that Brightpoint will not provide support for Penryn based processors used in VBI Santa Rosa barebones and their use is at customer’s own risk and can result to warranty void. Brightpoint will provide full support for Penryn processors on the Santa Rosa Refresh barebones. Please forward this mail to your customers to help us eliminate related queries. Thank you for understanding in this matter. Best regards Brightpoint Slovakia s.r.o. Todos os modelos COMPAL FL90/91 , FT00 VBI ou Original Design perdem a garantia face ao fabricante se montados com os novos processadores INTEL Core 2 Duo PENRYN pois não são plataforma Intel Santa Rosa Refresh. Apenas os COMPAL da série FL92 / FT02 têm suporte total para os novos processadores PENRYN.'
