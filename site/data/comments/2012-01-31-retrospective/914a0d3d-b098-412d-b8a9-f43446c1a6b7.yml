body: 'Hi Nick, I''ve just tested and the plugin worked with dates before 1970 in my server (PHP 5.3.5-1ubuntu7.11). Do you have any idea how can I reproduce the bug? What version of PHP are you running in your server? What''s the output of date("d/m/Y", -1000000000) and strtotime("01/01/1910")? Here the outputs are respectivelly 24/04/1938 and -1893427200. What happens with the post in WordPress when you make it old? Thanks for the feedback! Tiago'
