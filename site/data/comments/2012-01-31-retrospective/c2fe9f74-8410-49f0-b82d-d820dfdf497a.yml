body: 'Hi Tiago, congrats to your plugin. It is great coding and I like the simplicity. Even as a non-professional WP-ler I could follow the structure and adapt it mostly to my needs. One thing would be interesting: As you see in my website, i put the retrospective plugin always at the bottom of every post as the main item for navigation. http://www.see-ro.com/02◦june◦2010-brighton-2/ The thing is, that the plugin has always the oldest post in front or as the "starting condition". It would be great, if retrospective would always have the starting condition at the actual post. Then the post-title would be also accurate. Any hints how this can be achieved ? I also the plugin in http://www.iao.me/the-book/ ... just to show you, how much your plugin is appreciated and that its potential is actually great ! Thanks again for this great plugin. I wonder why not more download it. Cheers Peter'
