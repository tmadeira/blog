body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nRunning a website like tiagomadeira.com is a lot like trying to fill a leaky bucket.\r\n\r\nYou promote, get website visitor, they drop out... you promote, get more website visitors, they drop out...\r\n\r\nBut today I wanted to address the \"leaky bucket\" effect that keeps website owners and online businesses running on a treadmill without reaching their income goals.\r\n\r\nI've identified 5 ongoing challenges that can keep you from reaching your business goals with your online business offering.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 1: Attracting Leads and Getting People to Opt-In\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain your website and sell your product, you need people who are interested enough to actually consider your offers.\r\n\r\nBuilding an engaged list of subscribers is the key here... but did you know there's a way your website can help you with that?\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 2: Converting Leads into Happy Paying Customers\r\n\r\nOnce you've figured out a way to get more people to join your email list, you need to tell them about your paid product and offerings in a way that converts.\r\n\r\nThe standard email marketing funnel works... but if they don't buy, there are more organic ways to get them to purchase your paid offerings right inside your website.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 3: Having a Leaky Checkout Experience & Losing Out On Sales\r\n\r\nOnce you've done all of the hard work of getting people to say yes to your paid offerings... you definitely don't want to lose out on sales by having a leaky checkout experience.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that 77% of people who click the “Buy Now” button never complete their order, but there's a way to recoup these sales.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 4: Increasing Return Customers and Recurring Revenue\r\n\r\nOnce you've got customers... your job is done, right? Not so fast!\r\n\r\nYou can offer more solutions, products, and ongoing access to these same customers over time... because the probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20% and the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 5: Customers Who Fall Off The Wagon and do not buy\r\n\r\nCustomer retention is key to the long-term success of your website. But it's normal for customers to fall off the wagon, get busy, and stop logging into your website.\r\n\r\nOr is it?\r\n\r\nIf you use smart nurturing strategies, you can keep your customers engaged and actively benefitting from your website to reduce drop offs and refunds.\r\n\r\nHow our software overcomes each of these ongoing challenges:\r\n\r\nThese are real challenges that never seem to go away...\r\n\r\nI know because I've been there myself. I've put in thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours figuring out what works, what doesn't, and how to fill my own website over the past 10 years.\r\n\r\nAnd I built all of the strategies to overcome these obstacles right into our best-selling lead converting software tool: http://www.talkwithcustomer.com\r\n\r\nTalk With Website Visitors is a widget which captures a website visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number and then calls you immediately, so that you can talk to the website visitors exactly when they are live on your website — while they're hot!
